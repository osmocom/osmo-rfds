osmo-rfds - RF delay simulator
==============================

This repository contains the source code for an RF delay simulator,
which can be used to artificially delay RF signals by a configurable
amount of [variable] delay.  This is useful to test timing control
loops in TDMA systems, such as GSM.

It is part of the [Osmocom](https://osmocom.org/) Open Source Mobile
Communications project.
